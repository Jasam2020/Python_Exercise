Dear Holvi, 

I have been in Finland, in Helsinki to be specific for the whole month of February 2020. Since then I fell in love with the place, 
culture, environment and how Finland ahead from any other countries when it comes to technology.

I'm an IT graduate and currently working in Bangkok,Thailand as Client Relation Specialist. My current career is not related to the field of my study, 
and a friend of mine had me realised to go back on track. I have started taking online courses for Java and Python and study more about machine learning 
and attending conference online.

I'm not well skilled for now, but I assure you that my desire will strive me harder. As you can see on my resume, I have 4 different job positions from different 
companies and to be honest I excelled in every position.

Hopefully you will consider my application as I am very much excited to be part of your company. 

Should you require further information, please do let me know and I will be more than happy to provide it.


I'm a fast learner and able to work well with any kind of tasks.









I would like to apply for the position posted. I'm currently living and working in Thailand as Client Relation Specialist in a Global Services International Company. I'm about to move in Finland this September, and I believe this position would be great opportunity for me to start with. 

Should you require more information, please feel free to contact me and I will be more than happy to provide to you.

Thank you so much in advance and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards, 
Jasmin
